## Installation 
1. Clone down the repo.

2. Change the hard-coded directory in ```lib/results``` to the directory that holds most of your Ruby code.

```ruby bin/runner.rb```
2. Enter the Ruby method you’re searching for. 
3. Your default Ruby editor will open with all 20-line snippets for each time you’ve used that method.
